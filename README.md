# iForestShield: Fraud Detection with Ensemble Learning and iForest Classifier
Fraud Detection with Ensemble Learning and iForest Classifier

iForestShield is a fraud detection project that utilizes ensemble learning and the iForest classifier to enhance fraud detection accuracy. This repository contains code for implementing the ensemble approach, conducting hyperparameter tuning, and achieving remarkable performance in fraud detection.

# Requirements #
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Python (version >= 3.6)
Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
# Dataset #
The dataset used for this project can be found at: Credit Card Fraud Detection (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

# Results #
The notebook will generate evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for each model on the test dataset. The ensemble approach is expected to achieve fraud detection accuracy of around 98%.

By running the hyperparameter tuning script, the model performance can be further enhanced, and accuracy can reach up to 99%.
